Initializing my first project for the Frontend Roadmap.
This project is gonna cover HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Typescript

"The goal of this project is to teach you how to create a structured, single-page CV using only HTML. You will focus on laying out your education, skills, and career history in a clean, semantic manner. Styling will be addressed in a later project."

It will start as a basic CV with HTML that will be incrementing with time.
